          <h3>Ornamental</h3>
          <p>
            “Information is not a disembodied abstract entity; it is always tied to a
            physical representation. It is represented by engraving on a stone tablet,
            a spin, a charge, a hole in a punched card, a mark on paper, or some
            other equivalent. This ties the handling of information to all the
            possibilities and restrictions of our real physical word, its laws of physics
            and its storehouse of available parts.”
            - Rolf Landauer, The Physical Nature of Information 
          </p>
          <h3>Physical Ideas</h3>
          <p>
            In 1948, Claude Shannon’s A Mathematical Theory of Information laid the
            groundwork for the digital age. It defined the term information ,
            introduced the unit the bit , and revolutionized how we communicate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shannon’s work gives us physical parameters to define an often
            perceivably abstract entity: information. It’s a seemingly strange and
            wonderful truth in the digital age that information is physical- where you
            are often lead to believe that information lives in the ether of clouds.
            Information encoded in the form of an individual’s idea therefore also has
            physical dimensions - despite some philosophers of information cloudily
            suggesting a possible immateriality and others scientifically refuting those
            suggestions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Digital Age, communication changed from limiting who gets to
            speak (radio) to limiting who gets to be heard (internet) requiring new
            forms of searching and sorting masses of information. This allows a
            multitude of ideas to coexist in real time like never before. It’s no accident
            that physical ideas are described as going ‘viral’. Ideas, or memes, mutate
            and evolve online (and elsewhere) like genes forming and reforming the
            biological tree of life in a feedback system.
          </p>
          <p>
            An idea. Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea takes hold of your
            mind it is almost impossible to eradicate. The Digital Age is a memetic
            pool of contending physical ideas. The microcosm of one’s mind leads to
            the mesocosm of debate leading to the macrocosm of the globe.
            Evolution defined in terms of emergent ideologies that are spread and
            encoded across physical boundary lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of Ornamental , the brain scanning EEG reader serves as a
            symbolic data-extracting channel from one’s mind. More specifically, the
            extraction of an idea in it most raw and often incomplete form on a noisy
            information channel. The idea takes the form of binary trees or L-systems
            that are the fundamental data structure of mapping analog signals to
            digital encodings. The scanned ideas mutate the binary trees as initial
            seed data for a thought that is in a constant state of mutation and flux. It is
            easy to classify an idea as a finalised stagnant thing, but Ornamental plays
            with the possibility of seeing cognitive ideas as temporal physical living
            entities, transferring form from brain to keystroke to pixel to paper to iris
            to brain, from host to host to host.
          </p>
          <h3>Technical</h3>
          <p>
            EEG brain data serves as ‘genotype’ seed data generating the
            ‘phenotype’ visual properties and behavior of mutating L-system forms.
            The data controls properties like branch segment length, segment
            rotation, behavior erosion between L-system layers, and grayscale color.
            Once scanned, these digital ideas occupy a gestating idea archive before
            entering a global systems to colonize minds.
            The global system is composed of attractors, representing individual
            minds, in 3D space. When the global system is detected as dormant, a
            scanned idea takes on the behavior of the space colonization algorithm
            translating itself into the global system in ‘analog’ physical form of open
            minds.
